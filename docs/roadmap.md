To do:
Create a scraper for the nid's
and a parser to add these to the NID's list

Create cron jobs to automate the running of the scrapers etc

Create a processor to detect changes between consecutive datascrapes, processor(intermediate) and scraper(intermediate) are combined into a single csv file at end

Create an automatic emailer to send the relevant information once scraped.

Create an automatic test suite to ensure that before each run, it is validated then the actual run is validated

Create a better data validation suite

Potential for time-series information, depending on scraper

Perhaps a system where clients fill out a form of what information they want, that gets parsed to the reader, which then takes the relevant information and emails it back.
